    "\n",
    "There are some conclusions to draw from the sales data analysis:\n",
    "- **The *Call* method**, which requires significant effort from the team, **performed the worst in key metrics**, such as average revenue per customer and overall revenue.\n",
    "- **The *Email* method**, the easiest for the sales team, **worked well in volume, attracting the highest number of customers and displaying the highest overall revenue** after the first 6 weeks of selling the products. \n",
    "- Nevertheless, the *Email* method loses scalability over time and does not achieve the highest average revenue per customer.\n",
    "- **The *Email + Call* method is attractive to fewer customers, but generates the highest average revenue**: customers who made a purchase after being approached by the *Email + Call* method tend to spend the most and to buy more items on average.\n",
    "- Moreover, the *Email + Call* method shows the highest growth in revenue (overall and in average revenue per customer) over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these reasons, I recommend following the next steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… **Discontinue approaches using the *Call* method**. \n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… **Continue using the *Email* method** since it allows for broader reach and requires little effort from the team.\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… **Continue using the *Email + Call* method**, since it attracts high-value customers and scales well over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… **Focus on customers with less than 10 years** of buying from the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve future analyses, I recommend:\n",
    "- Tracking the total number of customers contacted by the sales team to assess how effective each method was in actually producing a sale.\n",
    "- Recording what products were sold to each customer to identify customer preferences.\n",
    "- Logging how much time the team spent on each customer to evaluate efficiency."
